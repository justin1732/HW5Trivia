# Timed Trivia Game
## How Well Do You Know Star Ocean?

This was the fifth individual project individual project for the University of Denver FullStack Coding Bootcamp.

This app displays quizzes users on Star Ocean characters and facts while timing down. If the user answers correctly, the app will inform them. It will also inform the user if the answer is incorrect.

## Using the App on Github

This app is deployed at https://justin1732.github.io/HW5Trivia/

## Starting the app locally

For a local version, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. Navigate over to my GitHub repo, located at https://github.com/justin1732/HW5Trivia , click clone, and be sure to type in the following below:
git clone
Then navigate to the HTML file and load it.

## Using this application

Users click on game start to start the game. The game then asks them questions and lets them know if they answered correctly or not. The next question loads after a set amount of time and the user starts the questions again. At the end of five questions, the quiz lets the user know how many they answered correctly and incorrectly, and gives them the option to try again. 

## Technologies Used

This application uses primarily HTML, Basic CSS, and Bootstrap CSS for rendering and viewing the elements. The app uses javascript elements from JQuery and Ajax to translate and show the information to the user. JQuery JS, Ajax, and Moment JS to translate the information received from the user and the database into a readable format. Javascript is the way the timer works as well.
